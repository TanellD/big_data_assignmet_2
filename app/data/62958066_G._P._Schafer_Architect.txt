Smith, landscape designer Deborah Nevins, decorator Bunny Williams, and color consultant Eve Ashcraft.Kerstin Czarra, "High Camp," C Home, Fall 2017.David Netto, "Team of Rivals," Veranda, March 2011.Cynthia Kling, "Gil Schafer & Miles Redd," Bridge for Design, Summer 2015, pp. 178–85.Michael S.

Initially an undistinguished, early-1990s chalet lacking an architectural back story, the barn-like near-A-frame (including a double- height, 30 x 30-foot great room) offered the opportunity for experimentation. It was gutted to the timber frames and rebuilt inside and out, with large windows, tall glass sliding doors, and dormer windows installed to maximize light and views of Blue Hill Bay. The interior—painted all white to enhance the light and views—bridges New England tradition and modernity with painted wood-plank walls and hardware reflecting rural history alongside eclectic, centuries-spanning furnishings.Gil Schafer III, "Total Recall," 'House & Garden, October 2017. === Additional residences === Schafer's second book, A Place to Call Home, explores the roles of geography, place and lifestyle in design, a theme visible in several projects that draw on regional vocabularies and context.Kiley Jacques, "With the Lake in View," Period Homes, March 2018, pp. 30–7.
