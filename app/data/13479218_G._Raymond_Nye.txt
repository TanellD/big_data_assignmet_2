He was noted for his striking appearance which consisted of dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. After many years of stage acting, he settled in Los Angeles where he lived with his father, U.S. Grant Nye, in the Sunset Junction section of the Silver Lake neighborhood of town according to the 1920 census reports. On October 3, 1929, at age 40, Nye walked into his apartment to find his father had committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. He also found an apology letter written by his father explaining that he was sorry for taking his own life and he couldn't "bear this physical condition." At 67 years old the elder Nye was suffering from the effects of three paralytic strokes. Nye continued to appear in films until the 1950s. ==Selected filmography== * The New Adventures of Terence O'Rourke (1915) - Prince Aziz * The Passing of Hell's Crown (1916, Short) - Chuck Wells * The Adventures of Peg o' the Ring (1916) - Big Bill Barnen * Liberty (1916, Serial) - Pancho Lopez * Is Any Girl Safe?
