After a failed surgery he told the assembled Winans family to say its good-byes, but the family asked if they could pray for Winans instead. Pastor Marvin Winans laid his hands on the surgeon's head, prayed and said, "You go back and take my son off the heart- lung machine. He will live." Deeb was shocked but he complied. Winans lived, and Deeb later said that the experience had brought some spiritualism to his practice. == Personal life == G. Michael Deeb was born in Pittsburgh, PA on July 25, 1949.
