G.H. Bass is an American footwear brand founded by George Henry Bass in 1876. == History == George Henry Bass (b. Wilton, Maine, 1843) began to work in 1876 in the shoemaking business as junior partner in E.P. Packard & Co. in Wilton. By 1879, he became the sole owner and changed the company name to G.H. Bass & Co. In 1887, the factory moved to Wilson Stream in order to use water-powered machinery. The National Plow Shoe was created for farmers in 1892. In 1906, the first Bass moccasin made was the “Bass Moccasin Cruiser”, designed to be a light and flexible shoe worn by woodsmen. By 1906 G.H. Bass & Co. became incorporated. In 1910, “Rangeley” style moccasin was created, and seven years later G.H. Bass & Co. created the Ski Moccasin. By order of the United States government, in 1918, G.H. Bass & Co. created The official Aviation Boot. It was designed for use in high altitudes wielding protection from the extreme cold. In 1920, G.H. Bass & Co. created a new style of moccasin called the “Woc-O-Moc”. Due to the evolution of the company’s core products, in 1924 the Bass Shoe “For Hard Service” becomes “Bass Outdoor Footwear” in G.H. Bass & Co. catalogs."Our Brands - Bass." Our Brands - Bass.
