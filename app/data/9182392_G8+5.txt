In March 2014, Russia was cast out of the Group of 8 due to its involvement in the 2014 Crimea crisis in Ukraine, so the G8+5 in its original form is unlikely to reconvene with Russia present. ==February 2007 declaration== On February 16, 2007, The Global Legislators Organisation (GLOBE International) held a meeting of the G8+5 Climate Change Dialogue at the GLOBE Washington Legislators Forum in Washington, D.C., where a non-binding agreement was reached to cooperate on tackling global warming. The group accepted that the existence of man-made climate change was beyond doubt, and that there should be a global system of emission caps and carbon emissions trading applying to both industrialized nations and developing countries. The group hoped this policy to be in place by 2009, to supersede the Kyoto Protocol, the first phase of which expires in 2012.BBC: Politicians sign new climate pact, February 16, 2007Guardian Unlimited: Global leaders reach climate change agreement ==Foundation== The G8+5 group was formed in 2005 when Tony Blair, then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in his role as host of the 31st G8 summit at Gleneagles, Scotland, invited the leading emerging countries to join the talks. The hope was that this would form a stronger and more representative group that would inject fresh impetus into the trade talks at Doha, and the need to achieve a deeper cooperation on climate change. Following the meeting, the countries issued a joint statement looking to build a "new paradigm for international cooperation" in the future. The G8+5 Climate Change Dialogue was launched on February 24, 2006, by the (GLOBE)GLOBE international in partnership with the Com+ alliance of communicators for sustainable development. ==Institutionalization== Following the 33rd G8 summit Heiligendamm 2007, German chancellor Angela Merkel announced the establishment of the "Heiligendamm Process" through which the full institutionalization of the permanent dialogue between the G8 countries and the five greatest emerging economies will be implemented. This will include the establishment of a common G8 and G5 platform at the OECD. Most recently on August 28, 2007, former French president Nicolas Sarkozy in a foreign policy statement proposed that Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa should become members of G8: "The G8 can't meet for two days and the G13 for just two hours.... That doesn't seem fitting, given the power of these five emerging countries." Nevertheless, as of 2008, a formal enlargement of the G8 is not a realistic political option, since the G8 member states have diverging positions on this issue. The United States and Japan have been against enlargement, the United Kingdom and France actively in favour, and Italy, Germany, Russia and Canada are reserved on the issue.. ==Current leaders== (The following list is in alphabetical order by nation) File:Alberto Fernández y Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva en São Paulo 2022 (3) (cropped).jpg| Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President File:Trudeau visit White House for USMCA (cropped).jpg| Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister File:Xi Jinping 2019.jpg| China Xi Jinping, President File:Зустріч Президента України з президентами Франції та Румунії, а також головами урядів Німеччини та Італії 76 (cropped).jpg| France Emmanuel Macron, President File:Olaf Scholz In March 2022.jpg| Germany Olaf Scholz, Chancellor File:Official Photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi Potrait.png| India Narendra Modi, Prime Minister File:Giorgia Meloni Official 2023 crop.jpg| Italy Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister File:Fumio Kishida 20211004.jpg| Japan Fumio Kishida, Prime Minister File:Reunión con el presidente electo y equipos de trabajo 6 (cropped).jpg| Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador, President File:Владимир Путин (13-11-2021) (cropped).jpg| Russia Vladimir Putin, President File:Cyril Ramaphosa - President of South Africa - 2018 (cropped).jpg| South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa, President File:Chancellor Rishi Sunak (cropped).jpg| Rishi Sunak, Prime Minister File:Joe Biden presidential portrait (cropped).jpg| United States Joe Biden, President File:Charles Michel 2019 (cropped).jpg| European Union Charles Michel, President of the European Council File:Official Portrait of Ursula von der Leyen (cropped).jpg| European Union Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission ==See also== *Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change *Gleneagles Dialogue *List of country groupings *List of multilateral free-trade agreements ==References== Category:International climate change organizations Category:Organizations established in 2005 Category:Organizations disestablished in 2014 Category:G7 summits
