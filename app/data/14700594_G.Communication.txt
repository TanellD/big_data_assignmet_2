G.Communication, also abbreviated as G.com, is a Japanese kabushiki kaisha based in Nagoya, Japan. The company is an operator of restaurant chains, juku (cram schools), and eikaiwa (language schools). == History == G.Communication Group was started in Aichi, Japan. Masaki Inayoshi first opened a private cram school in 1994 called "Ganbaru Gakuen". G.Communication grew rapidly due to aggressive mergers and acquisitions. Headed by Inayoshi, the firm expanded its business by purchasing shares of restaurant chains, including sushi chain Heiroku in July 2005 and Yakinikuya Sakai Co. in May 2007. The aggressive strategy has at times caught the attention of the government. In October 2006, the Financial Services Agency ordered G.Communication to pay a ¥390,000 fine for insider trading after purchasing shares of one of its subsidiaries that was planning a capital increase before the information became public. In 2006, it acquired all of the shares of an English-language school chain in Hokkaido with some 50 schools, merging it into G.Education, part of the group. In November 2007, G.Communication took over Nova after it filed for bankruptcy in November 2007. Following the April 2010 bankruptcy of GEOS, G.Communication also took over 230 schools owned by the company.英会話学校のジオスが破産申請 負債７５億円 Asahi Shimbun, April 21, 2010. Retrieved April 21, 2010.
