Gwilym Cuthbert Grindley (1903–1976) was a British psychologist, best known for pioneering work in what later became known as operant conditioning.Zangwill, O. L. (1977). Obituary: G.C. Grindley (1903–1976). Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 29, 1–5 Grindley has been cited as one of the first scientists to develop the concept of optical flow. ==Biography== Grindley's academic career began at the University of Bristol, where he studied physics; his first publications were on emission spectra,Tyndall, A. M., & Grindley, G. C. (1924). The emission from an incandescent platinum wire in air. Philosophical Magazine, 47, 689-702. doi:10.1080/14786442408634408 based on work with A. M. Tyndall. However, he became interested in animal learning, and began work under Conwy Lloyd Morgan, who was then emeritus Professor of Psychology and Ethics at Bristol. He carried out pioneering research on learning in chickens,Grindley, G. C. (1927). Experiments on the "direction of association" in young chickens. British Journal of Psychology, 17, 210-221. working within the framework of Pavlovian conditioning. These studies included a very early investigation of what is now called conditioned reinforcement,Grindley, G. C. (1929). Experiments on the influence of amount of reward on learning in young chickens. British Journal of Psychology, 20, 173-180. according to MackintoshMackintosh, N. J. (1974). The psychology of animal learning. London: Academic Press, p.235 the first to investigate this phenomenon. Grindley subsequently moved to a faculty post at the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Cambridge, and in 1932 published his best known paper, on learning in guinea pigs.Grindley, G. C. (1932). The formation of a simple habit in guinea pigs. British Journal of Psychology, 23, 127-147. doi:10.1111/j.2044-8295.1932.tb00655.x This was in effect an investigation in operant conditioning, though that name was not in use at the time, and the work was done independently of the contemporaneous development of operant conditioning procedures in rats by B. F. Skinner. SkinnerSkinner, B. F. (1963). Operant behavior. American Psychologist, 18, 503-515. doi:10.1037/h0045185 acknowledged Grindley as one of a number of researchers who independently developed operant techniques in the 1920s. In 20th-century reviews of the literature of comparative psychology, he is widely recognized as a pioneer of the discipline.Thorpe, W. H. (1963), Learning and instinct in animals, rev. edn., London: MethuenHinde, R. A. (1966), Animal behaviour. New York: McGraw-Hill Grindley remained at Cambridge for the rest of his career, as a lecturer in the Department of Experimental Psychology; his subsequent research was on processes of visual perception and visual cognition, particularly visual attention.Grindley, G. C., & Townsend, V. (1968). Voluntary attention in peripheral vision and its effects on acuity and differential thresholds. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 20, 11-&. doi:10.1080/14640746808400123 Grindley was one of the eight founder members of the Experimental Psychology Group, which later became the Experimental Psychology Society.Zangwill, O. L. (1967). The Experimental Psychology Group, 1946-1958. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 19, 368-370. doi:10.1080/14640746708400118 History of the EPS: Beginnings In 1947 he made a donation of £1000 (over £40,000 at 2021 values https://www.in2013dollars.com) to the Group to enable it to found a journal, the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology. At his death, he left a significant bequest to the Society, which used it to found a system of grants to research students for conference attendance, known as "Grindley grants". Among colleagues, Grindley was always referred to as "C", or, in his later years, "old C". ==Selected publications== *The Intelligence of Animals (1950) *The Sense of Pain in Animals (1959) ==References== ==External links== *Cartoon of Grindley on the Experimental Psychology Society website Category:1903 births Category:1976 deaths Category:20th-century British psychologists Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol Category:Animal cognition writers
