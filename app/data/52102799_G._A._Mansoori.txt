Gholam Ali Mansoori (born in 1943), G. Ali Mansoori also known as "GA Mansoori" is an Iranian-American scientist known for his research within energy, nanotechnology and thermodynamics. He is a professor at the Departments of Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering and also Physics at University of Illinois at Chicago. == Life and education == Mansoori completed his PhD at the University of Oklahoma in 1969 with a dissertation on "A Variational Approach to the Equilibrium Thermodynamic Properties of Simple Liquids and Phase Transitions". Mansoori did post-doctoral work at Rice University. == Career == Mansoori contributed to over 550 publications including ten books, some of which became text-book references in thermodynamics and nanotechnology. The most cited work he has co-authored is Equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the mixture of hard spheres in The Journal of Chemical Physics in 1971 with more than 2000 citations as of February 2019. ==Books== A list of Mansoori's books is: *Mansoori, G.A. and Enayati N., Agyarko L.
