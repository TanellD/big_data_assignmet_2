G-Taste is a Japanese erotic manga series written and illustrated by Hiroki Yagami and serialized in Kodansha's Mr. Magazine (1996–2000) Young Magazine Uppers (2000–2004). The "G" in "G-taste" is used symbolically as the letter between "F" (for "Fetish") and "H" (for "hentai"). The anime has been licensed in the US by SoftCel Pictures. However the rights have since expired and now Critical Mass has since bought the rights. Not all of the series has been licensed as only the first five episodes have been released in the US. Episodes 6 and 7 have, to date, not been released in the US at all. An additional single episode OVA was released in 2010 bundled with the G-Best - G-Taste Best Selection compilation manga from Kodansha. The G-taste comics consist of a collection of four scene erotic vignettes, which typically each focus on a particular female character. Characteristically, they feature very little male involvement in sexual acts, which contributes to the voyeuristic atmosphere. They are not usually very graphic, abiding by the Japanese legal restriction on not showing genitals. Some of the activities shown include masturbation, bondage, lesbian sex etc. ==Characters== The characters of G-taste include the stock figures of Japanese pornography, including the school girl, office clerk, secretary, nurse, waitress, receptionist, campaign girl, maid, doctor, teacher, wife and mother. ===G-taste #1=== * Takaoka Yōko (高岡 陽子): An office lady. * Kisaragi Riona (如月 里緒菜): An office clerk who feels aroused when wearing red clothes. * Shihōdō Yuki (四方堂 由姫): A housewife who often prefers to wear Chinese cheongsam. * Nagai Reiko (永井 麗子): An office lady. * Mizukoshi Sayaka (水越 沙耶香): A high school teacher who engages in forbidden relationships. * Morimura Nana (森村 奈々): A maid employed by Baron Masquerade. * Endō Miki (遠藤 美季): A high school student who wants to get an all-over tan. * Takigawa Aya (多岐川 綾): An office lady. * Akiyama Asami (秋山 麻美): An office lady. * Okazato Shōko (岡里 翔子): A lady who loves to dress in high heels and tight clothing. * Tsuchiya Emiri (土屋 絵美理): A fleeter who loves to dress in leathers and dominatrix clothing.G-taste #1, published 9 July 1997 by Kodansha ===G-taste #2=== * Yagisawa Moe (八木沢 萌): An office lady. * Leotard High Heels (レオタード・ハイヒール): A space police officer who often finds herself bound up in shibari; her real name is unknown. * Kawamura Misuzu (川村 美鈴): A high school student who loves to expose herself to her brother, also became Mizukoshi Sayaka's lover. * Jōgasaki Yui (城ヶ崎 唯): A waitress. * Fujisawa Ryōko (藤沢 涼子): A woman who likes to dress in traditional clothing. * Nishina Aoi (仁科 葵): A bus guide. * Senō Asuka (瀬能 明日香): A nurse. * Fubuki Kyōka (風吹 京花): A doctor who works at the same hospital Asuka works at, who often does "personal examinations" with the nurse. * Saotome Keiko (早乙女 慶子): A teacher. * Mochizuki Kana (望月 香奈): A student who is seduced by Keiko after she is caught masturbating. * Baron Masquerade (マスカレード男爵): A wealthy person who spies on women through many means; later, it is revealed that the Baron is a woman.
