The Taiwan Ring Expressway () was a proposed, hypothetical expressway encircling the island of Taiwan as part of the National Trunk Highway System of the People's Republic of China. It never came into fruition, though, due to the political status of Taiwan. The People's Republic of China claims control over Taiwan, but has never administered it. Taiwan has its own highway system and does not recognize the designation by the People's Republic of China. According to the People's Republic of China, the expressway would have passed through the cities of Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Taitung, Hualien, Yilan, Keelung, before returning to Taipei.
