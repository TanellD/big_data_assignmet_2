The G. W. S. Allen House is a historic house located at 207 East Henry Street in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. == Description and history == It was constructed according to mail order plans provided by George F. Barber & Co. of Knoxville, Tennessee. The final design is a combination of two designs offered in Barber's 1899 catalog and modifications by the Allens and their builder. It was one of several Barber-designed houses in Mount Pleasant. with The 2Â½-story Queen Anne has an irregular plan, frame construction, a full basement, hip roof with lower cross gables, and circular tower with a conical roof. Because the house is from the later stage of the Queen Anne style it features decorative elements from the Neoclassical and the Neocolonial styles instead of Eastlake detailing. The house was built by George S.W. Alien, a Vermont native, who operated his own clothing store. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1985. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1900 Category:Queen Anne architecture in Iowa Category:Houses in Mount Pleasant, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Henry County, Iowa Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa
