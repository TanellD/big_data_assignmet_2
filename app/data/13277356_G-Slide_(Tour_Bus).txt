(Note that when she leaves the building, the maroon awning reads "CHATEAU MAMA" in white letters.) Then, her little sister tells her she doesn't have a tour bus. Using her magic dance moves, she creates one. The next scene shows kids in a neighborhood dancing, when an ice cream truck with lip gloss inside comes. Lil' Mama and some other girls grab it and start applying. After this, the screen turns darker and the beat changes considerably; from nursery rhyme to rap. Lil' Mama and some backup dancers are then seen dancing. It then cuts to daytime where the children from the intro are shown singing the chorus of the song, after which the song ends. ===How She Move version=== The How She Move version is very similar to the original, but it has clips from the movie, and it reads "How She Move" on a building. ==Track listing== #"G-Slide (Tour Bus)" (Radio version) #"G-Slide (Tour Bus)" (Instrumental) #"G-Slide (Tour Bus)" (Video version) #"G-Slide (Tour Bus)" (A cappella) ==Charts== Chart (2007) Peak position ==External links== * Music video for "G-Slide (Tour Bus)" at KOvideo.net ==References== Category:2007 singles Category:2007 songs Category:Lil Mama songs Category:Jive Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Benny Blanco Category:Song recordings produced by Dr. Luke Category:Song recordings produced by Lil Jon Category:Songs written by Dr. Luke
