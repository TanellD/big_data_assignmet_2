G. M. Kumar is an Indian actor who has appeared in Tamil language films. He won Nandi Award for Second Best Story Writer film Muvva Gopaludu (1987)(in Telugu) its an official remake of his own film Aruvadai Naal ==Personal life== GM kumar was born in 1957 in Avadi.As a child he got the chance to view many films.Soon he moved to film industry as assistant director to K. Bhagyaraj.He had worked with Livingston and R.P.Vishwam for movies like Kakki Sattai, Kanni Rasi. ==Career== Kumar debuted in films by directing Sivaji Productions' Aruvadai Naal (1986) with Prabhu in the lead role. The film won good reviews and fetched Kumar several offers to make more films, though he noted that he rejected several as the producers were unwilling to have Ilaiyaraaja as composer. His next two directorial venture Pickpocket and Uruvam were disasters. The film Irumbu Pookal's music did well as two songs were composed by M.S.Viswanathan, however the film failed at the box office. Due to his insistence that he will direct only if music is by Ilaiyaraaja, he lost films. Thus his market value significantly diminished and only went to make three more films despite his initial success. His decision to produce and direct Uruvam became a financial failure and put him into bankruptcy. He ended up making his acting debut as a villain in Bharathiraja's Captain Magal (1992), before disappearing to make documentaries and to study anthropology. In the early 2000s, he was once again on the verge of bankruptcy and chose to act in minor roles offered by his protege Raj Kapoor, in films including Ramchandra and the unreleased Sivalingam IPS. He expressed his surprise at being given an offer by Shankar's production house and took up the role in Veyil (2006) to make ends meet, winning acclaim for his role. Bala approached him to star in Avan Ivan as a character called Highness, with his performance winning him a nomination for the Vijay Award for Best Supporting Actor. Critics labelled his performance as "riveting", though the film only won average reviews. ==Filmography== ===Acting credits=== Year Film Role Notes 1993 Captain Magal 2002 Kadhal Virus Himself 2003 Ramachandra Kumar 2005 Thotti Jaya 2006 Veyil Mayandi Thevar 2007 Machakaaran Rajangam Malaikottai 2008 Aayudham Seivom Annaachi Kuruvi Bhai 2009 Mayandi Kudumbathar Virumandi Thee J.P. 2010 Maathi Yosi Milaga 2011 Avargalum Ivargalum Chinnasamy Avan Ivan Zamindar Thirthapathi (Highness) Nominated, Vijay Award for Best Supporting Actor Vellore Maavattam Sankarankovil 2013 Chandhamama 2014 Jagajala Pujabala Thenaliraman Appuchi Gramam 2015 Sandamarutham Thoppi Suruttu Saamy Agathinai Ayanaru's father Yatchan 2016 Tharai Thappattai Samipulavan Ennama Katha Vudranunga 2017 Saravanan Irukka Bayamaen Thirappu Vizha Enbathettu Velaiilla Pattadhari 2 Chettiyar Kida Virundhu 2018 Jarugandi Chalo 2019 Naan Avalai Sandhitha Pothu 2021 Chidambaram Railwaygate Karnan Dhuriyodhanan 2022 Radha Krishna Tribal Group leader Pattathu Arasan 2023 Bommai Nayagi Velu's father Pallu Padama Paathukka A blind rich man Burqa ===Directing credits=== Year Film Notes 1986 Aruvadai Naal 1989 Pickpocket 1991 Irumbu Pookkal Uruvam ===Writer=== Year Film Notes 1985 Kanni Rasi 1985 Kakki Sattai 1990 My Dear Marthandan ==Television== * Devathayai Kanden (2017) as Vasudevan's grandfather * Poove Unakkaga (2020) as Shankaralingam * Sembaruthi (2021) as Aadhikadavur" Aadhi Parameswaran * Peranbu (2022-present) == Web series == Year Title Role(s) Language Notes 2021 November Story Ganeshan Tamil Debut Web Series 2022 Paper Rocket Grandfather ==References== ==External links== *G.
