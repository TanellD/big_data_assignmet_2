G.652 is an international standard that describes the geometrical, mechanical, and transmission attributes of a single-mode optical fibre and cable, developed by the Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) that specifies the most popular type of single-mode optical fiber (SMF) cable. == History == G.652 was originally developed in 1984 by ITU-T Study Group XV. Subsequently, revisions were published in 1988, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2009, and 2016 (from 1997 as Study Group 15). == Standard == The standard specifies the geometrical, mechanical, and transmission attributes of a single-mode optical fibre as well as its cable. The fibre has zero-dispersion wavelength around 1310 nm as per how it was designed, however it can also be used in the 1550 nm wavelength region. == References == Category:ITU-T recommendations Category:ITU-T G Series Recommendations
