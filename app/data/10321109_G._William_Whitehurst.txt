He was the first Republican to represent that part of Virginia since the Great Depression, and only the second Republican elected to a full term from that district in the 20th century. He was re-elected eight more times without serious difficulty. In 1974, for instance, even as Republicans were swept out in the face of voter anger over Watergate, Whitehurst still won comfortably with almost 60 percent of the vote. The Democrats didn't even put up a candidate from 1978 to 1984, and on three of those occasions Whitehurst was completely unopposed. In 1986, Whitehurst stated his support of naturalization of Filipinos who were serving in the United States Navy. He retired in 1987 after declining to run for a tenth term. For most of his tenure in Congress, he served on the Armed Services Committee. He also served on the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Ethics Committee. After his service in Congress, Whitehurst returned as a faculty member at Old Dominion University in 1987, where he still teaches. He also served for many years as an analyst for WTKR in Norfolk. He is also an active United Methodist and has served on the Board of Visitors of the Tidewater Wesley Foundation, the United Methodist Campus Ministry at Old Dominion University, for many years.http://www.tidewaterwesley.org ===Electoral history=== *1968; Whitehurst defeated Democrat Frederick T.
