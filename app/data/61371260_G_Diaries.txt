G Diaries is a Philippine travel and lifestyle television program created by ABS-CBN Foundation. It features destinations throughout the Philippines for an effort to support ecotourism. The program debuted on ABS-CBN on June 10, 2017, as part of special programming, until it became a regular TV show in later seasons. Gina Lopez served as the main host until her death in August 2019. Ernie Lopez took over the hosting duties onwards. The program stopped broadcasting on ABS-CBN after the network ceased its free-to-air broadcast operations as ordered by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and Solicitor General Jose Calida. The program later returned on Kapamilya Channel, with Michelle Lopez joining as co-host. However, the show aired its final episode on March 27, 2022, and past episodes started on April 3. ==Host== * Gina Lopez * Ernie Lopez * Michelle Lopez ==Accolades== Year Award Category Recipient Result 2018 32nd PMPC Star Awards for Television Best Travel Show G Diaries Best Travel Show Host Gina Lopez 2019 33rd PMPC Star Awards for Television Best Travel Show G Diaries Best Travel Show Host Gina Lopez ==See also== *List of ABS-CBN specials aired ==References== ==External links== * Category:ABS-CBN television specials Category:Philippine travel television series Category:Philippine documentary television series Category:2017 Philippine television series debuts Category:2022 Philippine television series endings Category:Filipino-language television shows
