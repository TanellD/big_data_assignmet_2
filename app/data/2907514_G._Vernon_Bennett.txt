Murphy."Takes a Bride," Los Angeles Times, August 5, 1910, page II-8 Near the end of his first school year, he responded to a statement by the University of California President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who had declared vocational training to be "an attempt at aristocracy to keep children of the laborer in the working class so they couldn't better themselves.""Useful Trade Best Defense," Los Angeles Times, April 10, 1915, page II-9 Bennett said: > That sort of talk is bosh. ... If teaching boys how to do interior > decorating, plumbing, lathe work and cabinet-making and teaching girls how > to make hats and dresses and custard pies is an aristocratic attempt to tie > a millstone around the neck of genius, then let us become more aristocratic. > If we can keep the boys and girls off the street and reduce the number of > street-corner loafers by teaching some useful trades in our schools I think > it is our duty to do so. Bennett ordained an anti-slang week in April 1915 and ordered that anybody who used slang in Pomona schools be penalized. "I'd like to eliminate such phrases as 'hand somebody a lemon,' 'cut it out,' 'the once-over,' and a lot of similar expressions," he said."Ods Bodkins, Me Lad, Desist Thy Slanging," Los Angeles Times, April 26, 1915, page II-6 In 1919 he was appointed head of the local office of the Federal Board for Vocational Education,"Choose Pomona Man, Los Angeles Times, May 31, 1919, page II-12 an agency that retrained returning U.S. servicemen."Wounded Now Students," Los Angeles Times, October 5, 1919, page V-20 In October 1920, Bennett and Nicholas Ricciardi, director of the vocational office in San Francisco, were attacked by the James B.

In February 1935, still a college professor and living at 3017-1/2 Hoover, he took out a nomination petition for the City Council seat in the 10th District, campaigning against the incumbent, E. Snapper Ingram. Bennett was supported by the End Poverty in California movement (EPIC) and opposed by the Los Angeles Times. Other candidates in the 10th District primaries were Lenna G. Walradt, a lecturer; Allan M. Rose, employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, Karl Euper, "in the insurance and real estate business," and Austin L. Tournoux, "in the publishing business"; he had been a member of the California State Assembly in 1933."Ingram Aids Vital Works," Los Angeles Times, March 23, 1935, page A-14"City Ballot Places Won," Los Angeles Times, February 19, 1935, page 5"Kersey for State Head of Schools," Los Angeles Times, August 26, 1934, page 15 Bennett received 5,974 votes to Ingram's 5,810, and they faced each other in the finals."City's Primary Vote," Los Angeles Times, April 4, 1935, page 2 In that race, Bennett won by a vote of 8,794 to 8,064."Complete Semi-official Election Returns," Los Angeles Times, May 9, 1935, page 2 1937 In 1937 Bennett ran as an incumbent against George McLain but without the support of EPIC."The Political Bandwagon," Los Angeles Times, March 8, 1937, page A-4 He won in the primary, 8,065 to 5,306."Complete City Primary Returns," Los Angeles Times, April 8, 1937, page 2 1938–39 He lost in another bid for state superintendent of public instruction in 1938.

Welch."Welch Unseated by Democrats," Los Angeles Times, September 9, 1942, page A-1 In late 1941, political reformer Clifford E. Clinton had accused Bennett, with other councilmen, of having misused city automobiles, asking for a grand jury investigation."Clinton Again Assails Joy Riding by Officials," Los Angeles Times, November 6, 1941, page A-2 The issue resurfaced in 1943, an election year, when Council Member Parley P. Christensen accused Bennett of having used a city automobile for an "unauthorized and illegal" trip to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1937 and on his return, "presenting the city with a bill for gasoline and oil." Bennett denied the charge."Bennett Trip Under Attack," Los Angeles Times, February 27, 1943, page A-1 In the 1943 election, Bennett was endorsed by the Times, which said that "Although inclined when first elected toward ultra-liberal views, years of practical experience have tempered Bennett's convictions."

Bratton, a certified public accountant, and Charles Downs, a builder who had been a City Council member in 1925 but was removed from office that year upon conviction of receiving a bribe from a developer."City Council Choices Made," Los Angeles Times, May 30, 1947, page 2 Bennett won in the April primary with 12,173 votes to 2,834 for Downs and 1,843 for Bratton (four precincts not reported)."Election Returns," Los Angeles Times, April 3, 1947, page5 Two years later, in 1949, Bennett was reelected without opposition."City Primary Election Is Important," Los Angeles Times, April 3, 1949, page A-4 1951 In 1951, running in the shadow of a morals charge (above) and deprived of a Los Angeles Times endorsement, Bennett was defeated for reelection after seventeen years in office.
