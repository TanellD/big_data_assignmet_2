Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit beta-1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the GABRB1 gene. == Function == The gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAA receptor) is a multisubunit chloride channel that mediates the fastest inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. This gene encodes GABA A receptor, beta 1 subunit. It is mapped to chromosome 4p12 in a cluster of genes encoding alpha 4, alpha 2 and gamma 1 subunits of the GABAA receptor. Alteration of this gene is implicated in the pathogenetics of schizophrenia. ==Clinical significance== Mice bearing mutant copies of this gene have been shown to be vulnerable to binge drinking of alcohol. ==See also== * GABAA receptor ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Category:Ion channels
