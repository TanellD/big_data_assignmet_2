Three University centers were eventually established in the French resort town of Biarritz, the English town of Shrivenham, Berkshire, and in Florence, Italy. These three campuses were set up to provide a transition between army life and a successful transition to civilian life, with career training and possibly attendance at a university in the US. Most students attended for just one term. Students removed their caps, and therefore the distinction between officers and enlisted personnel was eliminated.The Biarritz American University (The BAU) ==Florence American University== The first American university for service personnel was established in June 1945 at the School of Aeronautics in Florence, Italy. Some 7,500 soldier-students were to pass through the university during its four one-month sessions from July to November 1945.The Army University Center No 2 Biarritz, France Precursor to the GI Bill by Tony James (paragraph 5) https://bcmss.sciencesconf.org/conference/bcmss/BAU.pdf (accessed 3/14/2023). ==Biarritz American University== Under General Samuel L. McCroskey, the hotels and casinos of Biarritz in France were converted into quarters, labs, and class spaces for U.S. service personnel. The university opened 10 August 1945, and approximately 10,000 students attended at least one eight-week term. BAU ran the longest of any of the centers and made a significant impact on both faculty and students, as well as the local community. The curriculum covered the range of subject of any state-side university, students established a full symphony orchestra, a choir, a theater group, and two basketball teams; a local hotel was rebuilt by the engineering class, a daily newspaper was published by the journalism program, and the theater program performed in local orphanages and hospitals. It was a return to "normal" and a stepping stone to a future for many.Mulligan, Hugh A. "From Battle to the Beach at Biarritz."
