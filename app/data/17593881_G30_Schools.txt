G30 Schools, formerly known as G20 Schools, is an informal association of secondary schools initiated by David Wylde of St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown, South Africa and Anthony Seldon of Wellington College, Berkshire, United Kingdom in 2006. The G30 Schools have an annual conference which aims to bring together a group of school heads who want to look beyond the parochial issues of their own schools and national associations and to discuss key issues facing education and their roles as "educational leaders". The association includes 50 schools from 20 countries, with membership by invitation and a vote of existing members. G30 schools are chosen on two criteria: the reputation of the school and the reputation of the school's leader. == Current members == * **The King's School **Carey Baptist Grammar School, Melbourne **Cranbrook School, Sydney **Geelong Grammar School **St Peter’s College, Adelaide **Melbourne Grammar School * **Appleby College **Upper Canada College * **High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China * ** Schule Schloss Salem * **SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College * ** Chinese International School * ** Mayo College, Ajmer ** Daly College, Indore ** The Doon School, Dehradun * ** King's Academy * **Brookhouse School * ** Aitchison College, LahoreAitchison College Lahore, About Us, https://www.aitchison.edu.pk/about-us.php * ** Markham College (Lima) * ** Xavier School * ** Raffles Institution * ** Diocesan College ** St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown ** St. John's College, Johannesburg ** St Stithians College * ** Korean Minjok Leadership Academy * ** Sigtunaskolan Humanistiska Läroverket * ** International School of Geneva * ** Taipei American School * ** Mahidol Wittayanusorn School * ** Robert College * ** Millfield ** Eton College ** Marlborough College ** Stowe School ** Wellington College * ** Buckingham Browne & Nichols (MA) ** Harvard-Westlake School (CA) ** Phillips Academy Andover (MA) ** Phillips Exeter Academy (NH) ** University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (IL) == Conferences == The G30 Schools conferences have been held in: Date School School country 2006 Wellington College, Berkshire 2007 Bishops Diocesan College and St. Andrew's College 2008 King's Academy 2009 Harvard Westlake School 2010 The King's School, Parramatta 2011 Geneva 2012 Phillips Exeter Academy and Buckingham Browne and Nichols 2013 Daly College 2014 Markham College 2015 Wellington College and Marlborough College and Stowe 2016 High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China (RDFZ), Beijing and Chinese International School, Hong Kong 2017 Brookhouse School 2018 Carey Baptist Grammar School 2019 Appleby College and Upper Canada College == Former members == * Argentina ** St. George's College, Quilmes * Australia: ** Ivanhoe Grammar School ** Scotch College * Hong Kong: ** Diocesan Girls' School * India: ** Dhirubhai Ambani International School ** Maharani Gayatri Devi Girls' School ** The Sanskaar Valley School ** Welham Girls' School * New Zealand: ** King's College (Auckland) * Singapore: ** Hwa Chong Institution * South Africa: ** Bishops Diocesan College ** St. Cyprian's School, Cape Town ** Tiger Kloof Educational Institute * United Kingdom: ** Sevenoaks School * United States: **Middlesex School (MA) ** Crossroads School (CA) ** Deerfield Academy (MA) ** Hotchkiss School (CT) ** Lawrenceville School (NJ) ** Polytechnic School (CA) == External links == * == References == Category:Associations of schools
