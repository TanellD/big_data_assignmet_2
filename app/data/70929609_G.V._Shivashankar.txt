His research focuses on understanding the coupling between cell mechanics and genome organization for the regulation of cell homeostasis and cell state transitions.People at Department of Health Science and Technology at ETH Zurich, retrieved 06-01-2022 In addition his group also developed imaging-AI based chromatin biomarkers as fingerprints for cells in health and disease.Scientific Highlights and News of the Mechano- Genomics Group at PSI, retrieved 09-03-2023 Towards this, his group employs multi-scale correlative bio-imaging methods combined with bioengineered interfaces, functional genomics, theoretical modeling, and machine learning.Mechano-Genomics Group at PSI, retrieved 06-01-2022 He currently holds a full professorship for Mechano-Genomics at the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zurich and he also heads the Laboratory of Nanoscale Biology at the Paul Scherrer Institute.People at PSI, retrieved 06-01-2022 == Education and career == Shivashankar was born in 1968 in India, where he began his academic career studying Physics at Bangalore University. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in 1988, he was a research fellow at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. He then joined the NEC Laboratories America, Princeton formally known as the NEC Research Institute and Rutgers University, where he obtained a Masterâ€™s degree in Engineering in 1994. Subsequently, Shivashankar joined the Rockefeller University, where he obtained his Ph.D. in Biophysics under the supervision of Albert J. Libchaber in 1999. In his doctoral thesis, Shivashankar developed new ways to combine single-molecule micromanipulation methods, thereby enabling novel insights into DNA-protein interactions.Shivashankar, G. V.
