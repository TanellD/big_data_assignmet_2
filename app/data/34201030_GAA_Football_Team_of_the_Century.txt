The Football Team of the Century was chosen as part of the Gaelic Athletic Association's centenary year celebrations in 1984 to comprise, as a fifteen- member side divided as one goalkeeper, three half-backs, two midfielders, three half-forwards and three full-forwards, the best football players of the first one hundred years of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The players on the team were nominated by Sunday Independent readers and were selected by a panel of experts and former players. A team was also selected of players who had never won an All-Ireland. __NOTOC__ Position Player County team Club(s) Team Number All-Ireland SFC, NFL and other honours Goalkeeper Dan O'Keeffe Kerry Kerins O'Rahilly's 1 All-Ireland SFC - 7 Munster SFC - 13 NFL- 1 Right corner-back Enda Colleran Galway Mountbellew–Moylough 2 All- Ireland SFC - 3 Connacht SFC - 7 NFL- 1 Full-back Paddy O'Brien Meath Skryne Seán McDermotts (Dublin) 3 All-Ireland SFC - 2 Leinster SFC - 5 NFL- 2 Left corner-back Seán Flanagan Mayo Ballaghaderreen 4 All-Ireland SFC - 2 Connacht SFC - 5 NFL- 2 Right wing-back Seán Murphy Kerry Dingle 5 All-Ireland SFC – 3 Munster SFC - 7 NFL- 1 Centre-back John Joe O’Reilly Cavan Cornafean 6 All-Ireland SFC - 2 Ulster SFC – 11 NFL- 1 Left wing-back Stephen White Louth Cooley Kickhams Mountbellew (Galway) Dundalk Young Irelands 7 All-Ireland SFC - 1 Leinster SFC - 4 Midfield Mick O'Connell Kerry Valentia Young Islanders 8 All- Ireland SFC - 4 Munster SFC - 12 NFL- 4 Midfield Jack O'Shea Kerry St Mary's (Kerry) 9 All-Ireland SFC – 7 Munster SFC – 10 NFL- 3 Right wing-forward Seán O'Neill Down John Mitchels 10 All-Ireland SFC – 3 Ulster SFC - 8 NFL- 3 Centre-forward Seán Purcell Galway Tuam Stars 11 All-Ireland SFC - 1 Connacht SFC - 7 Left wing-forward Pat Spillane Kerry Templenoe 12 All-Ireland SFC - 8 Munster SFC - 11 NFL- 2 Right corner-forward Mikey Sheehy Kerry Austin Stacks 13 All-Ireland SFC - 8 Munster SFC – 11 NFL- 3 Full-forward Tom Langan Mayo Ballycastle 14 All-Ireland SFC - 2 Connacht SFC – 3 Left corner-forward Kevin Heffernan Dublin St Vincents 15 All-Ireland SFC - 1 Leinster SFC - 4 ==References== Category:Gaelic football awards Team
