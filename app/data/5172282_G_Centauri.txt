G Centauri is a single star in the southern constellation of Centaurus. It is visible to the naked eye as a faint, blue-white hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of +4.82. This object is located approximately 450 light years from the Sun, based on parallax. It is a member of the Lower Centaurus–Crux group of the Scorpius–Centaurus association, with the former having an age of about 17 million years. This object is a B-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of B3V(n), where the 'n' indicates "nebulous" (broad) lines due to rapid rotation. It is around 16 million years old with a projected rotational velocity of up to 298 km/s. The star has six times the mass of the Sun and 3.4 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 483 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 13,732 K. An infrared excess indicates a circumstellar disk of dust with a mean temperature of 50 K is orbiting the star at a separation of . == References == Category:B-type main-sequence stars Category:Circumstellar disks Category:Centaurus Centauri, G Category:Durchmusterung objects 108257 060710 4732 Category:Lower Centaurus Crux
