The discography of South Korean pop music group g.o.d includes eight studio albums, a compilation album and a single album. Debuting in 1999, the quintet released five studio albums before the departure of a member. The remaining members released another two albums as a quartet before going on an extended hiatus. Their eighth album was released in July 2014 to mark their reunion as a quintet and the 15th anniversary of their debut. ==Albums== ===Studio albums=== Title Album details Peak chart positions Sales KOR The Recording Industry Association of Korea (RIAK) tracked physical album, EP, and singles sales and released a consolidated sales and ranking chart monthly from January 1999 to September 2008. It did not track digital sales. The Gaon Music Chart was established in 2010 and is compiled by the Korea Music Content Industry Association, the successor organization of the RIAK. From January 2018, the Gaon Music Chart no longer publicizes sales figures but utilizes an index which accumulates sales figures from both physical and digital sales.
