The GB3 Championship is a single seater motorsport series based in the United Kingdom. The championship is the UK's premier single-seater category, and is aimed at young racing drivers moving up from FIA Formula 4 championships or Karting. Having previously been known since 2013 as the BRDC Formula 4 Championship, the championship was renamed the BRDC British Formula 3 Championship with the backing of the FIA in March 2016. The championship was rebranded to GB3 Championship in August 2021. ==History== On 23 March 2016, the FIA and MSA revealed to the FIA World Motor Sport Council that an agreement had been reached the day prior to rebrand the BRDC Formula 4 Championship in order to reflect the increased pace of the new car designed for the 2016 season, and to fill the void left after the British Formula 3 Championship folded in 2014.BRDC Formula 4's British Formula 3 rebrand goes ahead for 2016 – Autosport, 23 March 2016 The series will co-headline seven of eight rounds with the British GT Championship. The BRDC British Formula Three Championship notably does not use a FIA Formula 3 car, instead using a car based on the Formula 4 specification that is elevated to the pace of F3 cars. The car is designed by Italian manufacturer Tatuus to the F3 safety regulations including side impact panels, front and rear carbon impact structures, wheel tethers and extractable seat. British engine and electronics manufacturer Cosworth provides the engine and related control electronics for the FA-016. The car also uses a unique Sadev limited slip differential.The Tatuus-Cosworth BRDC British F3 Car – BRDC British F3, 17 January 2018 The cars are around the same pace as the previous FIA F3 specification car used prior to the series folding in 2014. The FIA have previously been stringent with assigning of national F3 status. The Euroformula Open Championship had to drop the F3 moniker due to it using an old specification Dallara F312 Formula 3 car and low specification engine that did not meet the standards set by the FIA's single-seater commission. The granting of the national F3 status to the Tatuus-Cosworth highlights the pace of the car in relation to the FIA's other formula specifications.BRDC F4 becomes British F3 on eve of 2016 season – PaddockScout, 23 March 2016 BRDC British F3 morphed out of the BRDC F4 category, which ran for three seasons before the new car was introduced. The F4 name was operated by the 750 Motor Club before being awarded to MotorSport Vision. Under the BRDC F4 moniker, British driver Jake Hughes was the first champion of the series in 2013, driving for Lanan Racing. The championship top three of Hughes, vice-champion Seb Morris and Charlie Robertson were all finalists in that year's McLaren Autosport BRDC Award. In 2014, George Russell was crowned champion following a dramatic victory in the season finale at Snetterton. Russell beat his Lanan Racing teammate Arjun Maini by just three points and went on to win the 2014 McLaren Autosport BRDC Award later in the year. Will Palmer was crowned the 2015, champion after a dominant campaign in which he took 12 victories from the 24 races. His HHC Motorsport teammate Harri Newey finished as runner-up, with Palmer subsequently named as the winner of the McLaren Autosport BRDC Award in December. In the first season of BRDC British F3, Matheus Leist secured the championship in the final weekend of the season, while British driver Lando Norris won three races and was named the winner of the 2016 McLaren Autosport BRDC Award in December. Enaam Ahmed claimed the title after a dominant campaign in 2017 which saw him win a total of 13 races. Linus Lundqvist won the championship in 2018, which also saw him claim a prize drive at the 2019 24 Hours of Daytona. Subsequent champions were Clement Novalak and Kaylen Frederick, both driving for Carlin. In August 2021 the series was renamed as GB3 Championship; British racing driver Zak O'Sullivan was the first to win the title under the new name. The following month, MSV announced a new support series would be launched with the GB4 Championship. Shortly after the rebrand, the series announced a new car would be used for 2022, the Tatuus MSV-022, with performance and safety upgrades including the addition of the halo. The new car has proven to be around two to three seconds a lap quicker than its predecessor.https://www.gb-3.net/news/2022/things-you-may-have-missed-from- the-oulton-park-gb3-opener ==Chassis specifications== ===GB3 Championship Car=== Tatuus MSV-022 Tatuus MSV-022 Constructor Tatuus Engine 2.0L Duratec Valvetrain Lubrication Dry sump Torque Horsepower 250 bhp spec Engine management Cosworth Ignition system Transmission Sadev SL75 LW 6-speed sequential Suspension Double wishbone Pushrod Chassis Carbon-fibre Tires Pirelli (2015) Brakes AP Racing 4-piston calipers Wheelbase 2760 mm Front track 1514 mm Rear track 1485 mm Weight 598 kg including driver The Tatuus MSV-022 car is a significantly more powerful car than Formula 4 machinery, with a more sophisticated aerodynamic package and increased downforce which elevates its pace to equivalent to European Formula Regional Series cars.
