Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit epsilon is a protein that in humans is encoded by the GABRE gene. The product of this gene belongs to the ligand- gated ionic channel (TC 1.A.9) family. It encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor which is a multisubunit chloride channel that mediates the fastest inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. This gene encodes an epsilon subunit. It is mapped to chromosome Xq28 in a cluster of genes encoding alpha 3, beta 4 and theta subunits of the same receptor. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. Brainstem expression of Îµ subunit-containing GABAA receptors is upregulated during pregnancy, particularly in the ventral respiratory group. ==See also== * GABAA receptor ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Category:Ion channels
