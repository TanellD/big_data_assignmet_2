Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-6 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the GABRA6 gene. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain where it acts at GABA-A receptors, which are ligand- gated chloride channels. Chloride conductance of these channels can be modulated by agents such as benzodiazepines that bind to the GABA-A receptor. At least 16 distinct subunits of GABA-A receptors have been identified. One study has found a genetic variant in the gene to be associated with the personality trait neuroticism. ==See also== * GABAA receptor ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Category:Ion channels
