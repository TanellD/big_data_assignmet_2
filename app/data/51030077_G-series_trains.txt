The prefix "G" is pronounced as Gao in the CR system, which is short for Gaosu Dongche meaning high-speed EMUs in Chinese. The numbering of G trains are defined by the prefix G followed by a train number.

G trains are also the only type of train that do not permit standees. == Rolling stocks == The G-series trains often use EMUs with a designed speed of or higher, covering both Hexie (CRH series) and the Fuxing (CR series). * CRH2C – The first type of high speed train running on ballast- free track.
