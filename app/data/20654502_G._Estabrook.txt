The opera, however, was written five years earlier when "Gussie" held a local contest for a story she could base an opera upon. Her younger brother, Henry, submitted the story of The Joust and won. For the 1882 production, Henry reworked the plot and largely changed the libretto. The work is, therefore, a joint effort between the two siblings.The Herald; Omaha, June 23, 1882 By 1896, her health was fading, and so she spent a summer abroad in Europe with her mother and friends in the hopes that her health would recover.World-Herald; Omaha, Feb. 28, 1896 It did not, and she died in Lincoln, Nebraska, from apoplectic paralysis on April 18, 1897.
