GAMA were given money for the full wages of workers as part of State contracts (€12.96 an hour), but paid only €2.20 (17%) to their workers, leaving the remainder in Dutch bank accounts which GAMA had access to. GAMA were exposed by Socialist Party elected representatives Mick Murphy and Joe Higgins in the spring of 2005. After a successful strike by its workers, there was a settlement, under which GAMA paid workers all their regular pay at full rates and came to a negotiated settlement on the overtime. The strike was the subject of a 2006 documentary produced by Frameworks Films. ===Disi Water Conveyance Project=== GAMA is currently engaged in a project to build a system to pump 100 million cubic meters of water per year 325 kilometers from 55 wells in the Disi Aquifer to Amman, Jordan. Because GAMA significantly contributed to the project funding, the firm will have ownership of the project for the first 25 years after completion, after which ownership will transfer to the Jordanian government. ==References== ==External links== *GAMA website (English) *Irish High Court Judgement on the case *RTÉ News coverage exposing low wages *RTÉ News coverage of Dutch bank accounts Category:Construction and civil engineering companies of Turkey Category:Construction and civil engineering companies established in 1970 Category:Turkish companies established in 1970
