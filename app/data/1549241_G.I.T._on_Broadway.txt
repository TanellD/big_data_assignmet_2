G.I.T. on Broadway, also known as Diana Ross and The Supremes and The Temptations on Broadway, is a 1969 television special produced by Motown Productions and George Schlatter-Ed Friendly Productions. The special, a follow-up to 1968's successful TCB program, is a musical revue starring Motown's two most popular groups at the time, Diana Ross and The Supremes with the Temptations. Containing primarily Broadway showtunes, the special was taped in mid-1969 and originally broadcast November 12, 1969 on NBC. Like TCB, the title of the program was derived from an acronym, this one standing for "Gettin' It Together". A soundtrack album for the special, titled Diana Ross and The Supremes and The Temptations on Broadway, was issued five days before the program aired. Though there were no singles released from this album in the US, "The Rhythm of Life" did become a Top 10 hit for the ensemble in Australia. Two months after its release, Diana Ross left The Supremes to embark upon a solo career. ==Cast== *Diana Ross & The Supremes: **Diana Ross **Mary Wilson **Cindy Birdsong *The Temptations: **Dennis Edwards **Eddie Kendricks **Paul Williams **Melvin Franklin **Otis Williams ==Song list of TV special== #"G.I.T On Broadway" #Broadway Medley #"The Rhythm of Life" #"Malteds over Manhattan" #Medley: ##"It Ain't Necessarily So" ##"Summertime" #"Fiddler on the Roof Medley" #"The Student Mountie" #"Leading Lady Medley" #"Let the Sunshine In" #"Funky Broadway" #"G.I.T.
