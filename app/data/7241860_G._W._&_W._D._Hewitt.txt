G. W. & W. D. Hewitt was a prominent architectural firm in the eastern United States at the turn of the twentieth century. It was founded in Philadelphia in 1878, by brothers George Wattson Hewitt (1841–1916) and William Dempster Hewitt (1847–1924), both members of the American Institute of Architects. The firm specialized in churches, hotels and palatial residences, especially crenelated mansions, such as Maybrook (1881), Druim Moir (1885–86) and Boldt Castle (1900–04). The last, which was built for George C. Boldt, owner of Philadelphia's Bellevue-Stratford Hotel at 200 South Broad Street in Center City Philadelphia (1902–04), is G.W. & W.D. Hewitt's best known building.David R. Contosta, Suburb in the City: Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, 1850-1990 (Ohio State University Press, 1992) ==Career== Hewitt worked in the office of John Notman, and became an expert on English ecclesiastical architecture. In 1867, he formed a partnership with John Fraser and Frank Furness, which lasted until 1871. The younger men formed their own firm, Furness & Hewitt, whose most notable building was the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1871–76). Louis Sullivan worked briefly as a draftsman for Furness & Hewitt (June – November 1873), and left descriptions of the Hewitt brothers (speaking of himself in third person as "Louis"): > George Hewitt [was] a slender, moustached person, pale and reserved, who > seldom relaxed from pose. It was he who did the Victorian Gothic in its > pantalettes, when a church building or something of the sort was on the > board. With precision, as though he held his elements by pincers, he worked > out the decorous sublimities of inanity, as per the English current > magazines and other English sources. He was a clean draftsman, and believed > implicitly that all that was good was English. Louis regarded him with > admiration as a draftsman, and with mild contempt as a man who kept his nose > in books. But Hewitt had a younger brother named John [sic], and John was > foreman of the shop. He was a husky, smooth-faced fellow under thirty. Every > feature in his clean cut, rather elongated face, bespoke intelligence and > kindness, in fact a big heart. He had taken a fancy to Louis from the start. > He was the 'practical man' and Louis ran to him for advice whenever he found > himself in a tight place. John was patience itself and made everything clear > with dainty sketches and explanatory notes. These drawings were beautiful > and Louis frankly told him so. He begged John to teach him 'touch' and how > to make such sketches, and especially how to 'indicate' so crisply. This > John did. In fact, it was not long before he made of Louis a draftsman of > the Upper crust, and Louis's heart went out to lovable John in sheer > gratitude.Louis Sullivan, Autobiography of an Idea (1924; reprint, New York: > Dover, 1956), pp. 190-96. Writing a half century after the fact, Sullivan misremembered William Hewitt's name (there was no John Hewitt). Furness & Hewitt continued until 1875, and George opened his own firm, making his brother William a partner in 1878. In the early 1880s, Henry H. Houston, a director of the Pennsylvania Railroad, began developing in the western Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia. The Hewitt brothers did the planning for the upper-class suburb and designed the principal buildings, including a resort hotel, the Wissahickon Inn (1883–84) (now Springside Chestnut Hill Academy); the first clubhouse for the Philadelphia Cricket Club (1883–84, burned 1909); Houston's own mansion, Druim Moir (1886); and St. Martin-in-the-Fields Episcopal Church (1888). More than 100 Chestnut Hill houses were designed by the Hewitts.James B. Garrison, Houses of Philadelphia: Chestnut Hill and the Wissahickon Valley (New York: Acanthus Press, 2008) p. 295. Horace Trumbauer did his apprenticeship with the firm. Phineas Paist worked for the firm, and became a partner in it. Following George's 1907 retirement, the firm continued as Hewitt, Stevens & Paist. ==Selected buildings== ===Churches=== * St. Peter's Episcopal Church of Germantown, 6000 Wayne Avenue, Philadelphia (1873) * Providence Presbyterian Church at Bustleton, 2087 Old York Rd., Burlington, New Jersey (1878)Providence Presbyterian Church * Church of Saint John the Evangelist, 1720 Old Black Horse Pk., Runnemede, New Jersey (1880–81) * Church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, 8000 St. Martin's Ln., Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia (1888)St. Martin in the FieldsSt. Martin in the Fields from Bryn Mawr College * St. Andrew's Church, 50 York St., Lambertville, New Jersey (1891)St. Andrew's Church ===Residences=== * "Maybrook" (Henry C.
