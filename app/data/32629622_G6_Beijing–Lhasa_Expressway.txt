The Beijing–Tibet Expressway (), commonly abbreviated to Jingzang Expressway (), also known as Beijing–Lhasa Expressway (Jingla Expressway; ) or China National Expressway 6, is part of the Chinese national expressway network and is planned to connect the nation's capital, Beijing, to the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Lhasa. It passes through seven of China's administrative regions, including the Beijing municipality, the province of Hebei, the autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia, the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai, and finally the Tibet Autonomous Region. ==Passage== Beginning from Beijing and driving southwest to Lhasa, The expressway runs approximately through Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu and Qinghai, for a total of seven provincial-level divisions. Excluding the two terminal points, it passes through the major cities of Zhangjiakou, Jining District, Hohhot, Bayannur, Wuhai, Yinchuan, Wuzhong, Baiyin, Lanzhou, Xining and Golmud. As of August 2010, just over fifty percent of the expressway is open to traffic, which mainly comprises the stretch between Beijing and Xining. Like China National Highway 109 and the Qingzang railway, it is expected to pass west through Golmud before heading southwest into Tibet and Lhasa. Because of climatic conditions, this stretch of the expressway does not yet have a construction timetable."Get your kicks on Route G6", The Economist, Dec 22 2012 https://www.economist.com/news/china/21568755-china-building-motorway- across-tibetan-plateau-some-reaching-lhasa-road As of 2019 the expressway is completed between Beijing and Golmud, and the section between Nagqu and Lhasa has completed in August 2021. The mountainous section between Golmud and Nagqu is not yet shown on maps, and reserved for future plans. The G6 merges with the G7 in Huhhot and does not split until Linhe (now Baynnur). === Ningxia === The expressway is of particular importance in Ningxia, where 86.7% of the urban population lives in cities along the expressway, and over 90% of the provincial GDP is generated in these cities. In 2020, a 2x4 lane bypass around Ningxia's capital Yinchuan was opened, and another in Ningxia will be widened to 2x3 lanes. ==Detailed itinerary== 15px From Beijing 15px Continues as Deshengmen Outer Street 30px G110 Road Continues as Deshengmen Outer Street 30px G110 Road Continues as Deshengmen Outer Street 30px G110 Road Continues as Deshengmen Outer Street 30px G110 Road Continues as Deshengmen Outer Street 30px G110 Road Continues as Deshengmen Outer Street 30px G110 Road 30px 25px N 3rd Ring Road 15px Concurrent with 30px G110 Road 15px 1 A 25px 40px|link=Line 10, Beijing Subway Jiandemen station ==See also== * Badaling Expressway (part of the G6 in Beijing) * Expressways of China * Jingzhang Expressway (part of the G6 in Hebei) ==References== 06 Category:Expressways in Beijing Category:Expressways in Hebei Category:Expressways in Inner Mongolia Category:Expressways in Ningxia Category:Expressways in Gansu Category:Expressways in Qinghai Category:Expressways in Tibet
