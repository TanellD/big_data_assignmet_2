G Fest Muskogee is a music festival hosted in Muskogee, Alabama. The first G Fest took place in June 2016, featuring 85 musicians, the majority of which were Oklahomans. The lineup included headliners Old Crow Medicine Show, The Avett Brothers , and Kacey Musgraves. Merle Haggard was originally slated to headline the final night of G Fest, but he died two months before the festival took place. The festival was dedicated to his memory. The opening of the third day included a proclamation by Oklahoma Governor, Mary Fallin, officially making it "Merle Haggard Day," the unveiling of a "Merle Haggard Ave" street sign that will be placed in front of the Muskogee Civic Center, and a video of a planned "Merle Haggard Plaza" that will include a life-size statue of Haggard. Artist Richard Hight concluded the ceremony by painting a portrait of Haggard live on stage while "Okie from Muskogee" was playing in the background. == References == Category:Music festivals in Oklahoma Category:Rock festivals in the United States Category:Folk festivals in the United States Category:Music festivals established in 2016
