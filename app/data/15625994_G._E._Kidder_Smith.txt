George Everard Kidder Smith (1 October 1913 – 8 October 1997) was an American _architect_ , _author_ , _educator_ , _photographer_ and prolific “ _builder_ ” of _books_ and _curator_ of _exhibitions_. He collaborated with some of the leading publishers and graphic designers – ranging from Elaine Lustig Cohen and Leo Lionni to Paul Rand – to produce books that were both highly informative and visually engaging. Some publishers include The Museum of Modern Art, Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Edizioni di Comunità and Penguin Books. Above all, Kidder Smith was an astute observer - in words and pictures - of modern architecture and the historic built environment of numerous cities and countries across the globe. During the 1950s and 1960s, thanks to his activism as a preservationist, he rallied a number of high-profile individuals and eventually helped prevent the Robie House and Villa Savoye from being demolished. In his New York Times obit published on October 26, 1997, Herbert Muschamp described G. E. Kidder Smith as a “civic watchdog.” == Biography == George Everard Kidder Smith was born in Birmingham, Alabama on October 1, 1913. He was the third of four sons of Francis Hopkinson Smith (1876–1948) and Annie Kidder (1880–1929), a wealthy Episcopalian couple originally from Baltimore. Furthermore, the author, artist and engineer F. Hopkinson Smith (1838-1915) was G. E. Kidder Smith’s great uncle. From an early age, he was inspired by stirring tales and later than at school he started his deep engagement with architecture and photography. He graduated from Princeton University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1935 and a Master of Fine Arts in 1938. In 1946 he was licensed as an architect. In August 1942, Kidder Smith married Dorothea Fales Wilder (1916-2015). During World War II he served in the U.S. Navy with special photographic duties, which gave him the chance to encounter Captain Edward Steichen (1879–1973). Later on, Kidder Smith and Dot – often accompanied by their two sons (Kidder Jr. and Hopkinson) – travelled the world documenting architecture and the built environment. He was a book author and exhibition curator on architecture in the United States and abroad. In his early career, Kidder Smith practised architecture and during the years he was visiting lecturer and visiting professor in prestigious institutions such as Yale University School of Architecture and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1959 Kidder Smith was awarded the AIA Medal for Architectural Photography. His photographs appear in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. G. E. Kidder Smith dedicated his life to the understanding and appreciation of architecture—and particularly of modern architecture,Angelo Maggi, G. E. Kidder Smith Builds. The Travel of Architectural Photography, Oro, Novato (CA) 2022, 255 and while his multifaceted work received praise from peers throughout his life, he has not received the historical assessment of other contemporary figures such as Julius Shulman and Ezra Stoller.Michelangelo Sabatino, “G. E. Kidder Smith’s Reputational Shadow”, foreword in Angelo Maggi, 2022, 10. He passed away at the age of 83, on October 8, 1997, at his home in Manhattan, caused to bronchiectasis. == BooksSee “Books as Building” in Angelo Maggi, 2022, 34-191. == * Philip Lippincott Goodwin, Brazil Builds: Architecture New and Old 1652–1942, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1943, with photographs by G.

To date only about 250 Kidder Smith photographs are stored on Corbis Historical / Getty Images website. == Further reading and exhibitions == * Maggi, Angelo, G. E. Kidder Smith Builds.
