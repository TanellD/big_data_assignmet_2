thumb|GPCR-Autoproteolsis INducing (GAIN) domain, rat latrophilin mediates autocatalytic cleavage of adhesion GPCRs The GAIN domain (G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) autoproteolysis-inducing domain) is a protein domain found in a number of cell surface receptors, including adhesion-GPCRs and polycystic kidney disease proteins PKD1 and PKD2. The domain is involved in the self- cleavage of these transmembrane receptors, and has been shown to be crucial for their function . Point mutations within the GAIN domain of PKD1 and GPR56 are known to cause polycystic kidney disease and polymicrogyria, respectively. ==References== Category:Protein domains Category:Receptors Category:Cell adhesion proteins Category:G protein-coupled receptors Category:Cell signaling Category:Signal transduction
