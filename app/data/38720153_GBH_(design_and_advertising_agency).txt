GBH (Gregory Bonner Hale) is a London-based design and advertising agency founded in 1999 by Jason Gregory, Mark Bonner and Peter Hale. The studio's proposition is that it ‘is not Design, it is not Digital and it is not Campaign, but it works in the space between these disciplines, fusing crafts in order to make work that cuts through’. == Publishing == GBH published its first major book, ‘Charm, Belligerence & Perversity: The Incomplete works of GBH’ in 2017 with Black Dog Publishing. The book attempts to convey what it takes to run a creative studio to young creatives and showcases the studio's 20-year output. ==Awards== In 2011, GBH was ranked No. 1 Design Agency worldwide according to the now defunct 'Pencil Rankings’, a collaboration between Design & Advertising Award and Education charity, D&AD; and The One Show, In New York. In 2012, GBH was ranked 2nd in the UK Top 50 Creative Survey, an annual industry ranking based on three schemes: D&AD; awards, Design Week awards and the Creative Review annual. ==Clients== GBH creates work in graphic design, identity, print, packaging, digital, retail, environment, advertising and online.
