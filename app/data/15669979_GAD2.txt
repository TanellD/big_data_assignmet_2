Glutamate decarboxylase 2 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the GAD2 gene. This gene encodes one of several forms of glutamic acid decarboxylase, identified as a major autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes. The enzyme encoded is responsible for catalyzing the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid from L-glutamic acid. A pathogenic role for this enzyme has been identified in the human pancreas since it has been identified as an autoantibody and an autoreactive T cell target in insulin-dependent diabetes. This gene may also play a role in the stiff-person syndrome. == Interactions == GAD2 has been shown to interact with GAD1. == See also == * Glutamate decarboxylase ==References==
