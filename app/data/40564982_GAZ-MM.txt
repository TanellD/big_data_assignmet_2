The GAZ-MM is a medium-duty truck (Class 4-Class 5) produced at the Gorki Auto Plant from 1938 to 1948, and then at the Ulyanovsky Auto Plant, up to 1956. The truck was a modernized variant of the GAZ-AA truck, but using the engine from the GAZ-M1, upgrading the vehicle's power to 50 hp. Due to some engine shortages at the factory, some believe that the actual mass-production of the GAZ-MM trucks only started in 1940, since the GAZ-M1 engine needed to get firstly used in the GAZ-AAA and BA-10 vehicles. In 1942 a simplified variant of the truck, with the GAZ-MM-V index started getting produced, due to material shortages, but limited production of the original "unsimplified" GAZ- MM continued. After the Great Patriotic War ended, the production of all the variants of the GAZ-MM fully restarted, but by that time the Gorki plant was producing the newer GAZ-51 truck, which was based on the design and pattern of the Studebaker US6 truck. Due to these reasons, the production of the GAZ-MM truck was transferred to the Ulyanovsky Auto Plant, where production lasted until 1956, when the vehicle was fully discontinued. ==Variants== Most of the variants of the GAZ-MM were just modernized variants of the ones from the GAZ- AA series. * GAZ-65: Prototype halftrack version.
