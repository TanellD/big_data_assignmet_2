The indoor stadium can also host other sporting events such as kabaddi, taekwondo, table tennis, boxing, judo, wrestling and weight lifting. ==Pedestrian bridge== The design of the indoor stadium involves segregation of spectators' access from the access of sports-persons and officials. Four large pedestrian bridges placed at the four cardinal points allow access to the spectators directly to the stands at the up-per level. A combination of ramps and staircases lead the spectator to a height of 3m from ground level, from where a 4m wide steel- truss bridge of 12m span leads the spectators to a circumferential corridor from where they enter into the stands. ==See also== * G.
