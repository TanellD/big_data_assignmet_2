Lidet's President Hiroyuki Suzuki, wanting to continue his involvement with professional wrestling, announced the formation of Gleat in August 2020, alongside Kiyoshi Tamura, Kaz Hayashi and Nosawa Rongai. The promotion features two brands: G Prowrestling, a traditional puroresu brand, and Lidet UWF, a shoot style brand inspired by UWF International. In July 2022, Gleat announced the creation of the G-Infinity Championship for its G Prowrestling brand. A four-team tournament was held from August 20, 2022, to August 24 to crown the inaugural champions. The tournament was won by Bulk Orchestra (Kazma Sakamoto and Ryuichi Kawakami). After the match, Nobuhiro Shimatani and Hayato Tamura, who are also members of the Bulk Orchestra stable, announced their challenge to the title. When Hayato Tamura suffered from an injury incurred on October 9, 2022, #StrongHearts (Shigehiro Irie and T-Hawk) became interim champions. ===Inaugural tournament=== ==Reigns== == Combined reigns == As of , . === By team === † Indicates the current champions Rank Team No. of reigns Combined defenses Combined days 1 Bulk Orchestra 1 6 276 2 Saito Brothers † 1 1 + -- #Strong Hearts -- 0 21 3 Bulk Orchestra 1 0 11 ===By wrestler=== Rank Wrestler No. of reigns Combined defenses Combined days 1 1 6 276 1 1 6 276 3 Jun Saito † 1 1 + 3 Rei Saito † 1 1 + -- Shigehiro Irie -- 0 21 -- T-Hawk -- 0 21 5 1 0 11 5 1 0 11 ==See also== *Professional wrestling in Japan ==References== Category:Tag team wrestling championships
