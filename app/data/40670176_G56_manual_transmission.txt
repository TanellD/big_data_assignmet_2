The G56 manual transmission was the last manual transmission available in a full-size pickup truck. It is also the only manual transmission being optioned in Class-4 and Class-5 trucks. The transmission uses Mopar ATF+4 transmission fluid. Ram trucks began running this transmission in the 2005 model-year trucks as a mid-year change to phase out the cast-iron 6-speed New Venture Gear 5600 transmission. ==Common applications== *2005 - 2018 Ram 2500 trucks *2005 - 2018 Ram 3500 trucks *2008 - 2018 Ram 4500 trucks *2008 - 2018 Ram 5500 trucks *Mercedes-Benz Atego Truck *Mercedes-Benz Vario 818 ==References== Category:Automobile transmissions Category:Pickup trucks
