G.B.H. is a 1991 soundtrack album by Elvis Costello and Richard Harvey, the first of two collaborations between the two. G.B.H was a seven-part Channel 4 series first aired in the UK in 1991. Despite the participation of Costello, the music is not rock, which was a surprise to critics at the time it was first released. ==Track listing== All compositions written by Elvis Costello and Richard Harvey unless otherwise indicated. # "G.B.H.
