GAFIA (along with derived forms such as gafiate and gafiation) is a term used by science fiction fans. It began as an acronym for "Getting Away From It All", and referred initially to escaping from mundane activities via fanac (fan activity). (writing as John Bristol) However, its meaning was soon reversed, and thereafter it referred to getting away from fandom and fannish doings. This can be either a temporary or a long-term separation. The 1959 Fancyclopedia says: A term closely related is "Fafia" or "Fafiation", from the acronym for "Forced away from it all." To fafiate is to decrease doing fannish activities, not because one prefers to do so, but rather because one is obliged to do so, usually due to lack of time. "Dafia", or "Drifting away from it all", has been proposed as an intermediate term, but is not in general fannish use. There are many fanzines using the term as a title: Ted White, Redd Boggs and Carl Brandon published science fiction fanzines titled Gafia, Gafia Advertiser and Gafiac. respectively, and there are many more.Fanzine Collection at UC Riverside, titles containing "gafi" The term is among the fannish expressions used most extensively in the book Fallen Angels, by Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle and Michael Flynn, whose major protagonists are mostly fans (active, covert, gafiated or fafiated). == References == Category:Science fiction fandom
