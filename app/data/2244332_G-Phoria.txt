frame|G-Phoria 2005 logoframe|G-Phoria 2004 logoG-Phoria is a former annual video game awards show started in 2003 and ended in 2009, produced by and for the defunct G4 network. Formerly the event was formatted like a regular awards ceremony taped in front of an audience, featuring celebrities such as Hal Sparks, Carmen Electra, Wilmer Valderrama and Anna Nicole Smith, and musical performances, along with a red carpet preview show, and some game premieres. In 2006, the control of the show was given over to X-Play, which made it a pure viewer's choice show hosted by Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb. After 2009 G-Phoria's honors were effectively blended into the traditional "year in review" show aired by X-Play in mid-December of each year until the show's end in 2012. == Winners of G-Phoria== === 2003 === G4 CROWNS "GLOW AWARD" WINNERS AT G-PHORIA CELEBRATION PRESENTED BY EB GAMES AND JEEP G4 - Press Thu.
