"G-Get Up and Dance!" is the lead single from Canadian rock band Faber Drive's second album, Can't Keep a Secret. It debuted and peaked at number 6 on the Canadian Hot 100. The song debuted on Halifax, Nova Scotia radio station 101.3 The Bounce in July 2009. The music video was released on August 19, 2009 via their official YouTube page. The band wrote and recorded "G-Get Up and Dance!" in Faber's barn. One night, they were in a bar and someone, who was working at the bar, noticed them and instantly put on "Second Chance". "Everyone just decided to go get drinks so the band decided to write a fun, party song". They were originally planning on releasing "G-Get Up and Dance!" under a side project called "Badass Moustache" but their record label convinced them to release it under Faber Drive. It was also co-written by Ricarda Faber, Faber's wife. ==Charts== Chart (2009) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2009) Position Canada (Canadian Hot 100) 48 ==References== Category:2009 singles Category:Faber Drive songs Category:Songs written by Brian Howes Category:Songs written by Pierre Bouvier Category:2009 songs Category:Universal Records singles The Wild & Turning Red
