Rennie-Smith, U. Oswald, A. Pézard, M. Vogel, G. Weiss G 1/12 is a decision issued on 30 April 2014 by the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO), holding that an appellant's identity in a notice of appeal can be corrected under , provided the requirements of are met. The Enlarged Board of Appeal also held that an appellant's identity can be corrected under , first sentence, under the conditions established by the case law of the Boards of Appeal. (see section 1.1.1) ==Background== The European Patent Convention (EPC), the multilateral treaty instituting the legal system according to which European patents are granted, contains provisions allowing a party to appeal a decision issued by a first instance department of the EPO. The appeal procedure before the EPO is a judicial procedure proper to an administrative court,"In decision G 1/99 (OJ 2001, 381) the Enlarged Board held that the appeal procedure is to be considered as a judicial procedure (see G 9/91, OJ 1993, 408, point 18 of the Reasons) proper to an administrative court (see G 8/91, OJ 1993, 346, point 7 of the Reasons; likewise G 7/91, OJ 1993, 356)." in : "Legal character of appeal procedure" > "General". and the EPO Boards of Appeal have been recognised as courts, or tribunals, of an international organisation, the EPO.G 2/06, Reasons 4, Official Journal EPO 5/2009 page 318 par. 4: "Whereas EPO Boards of Appeal have been recognized as being courts or tribunals, they are not courts or tribunals of an EU member state but of an international organization whose contracting states are not all members of the EU." When an appeal is lodged, the notice of appeal has to contain specific information including "the name and the address of the appellant", "an indication of the decision impugned", and "a request defining the subject of the appeal".; see also . The question has arisen as to whether the name of the appellant could be corrected after filing the notice of appeal, and questions have been referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal under in that regard. ==Questions referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal== The referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal lies from an interlocutory decision T 445/08Decision T 445/08 of 30 January 2012 from Technical Board of Appeal 3.3.07. The referred questions were: ==Answers to the referred questions== The Enlarged Board of Appeal answered these questions as follows: This means that the flexible approach adopted in earlier decision T 97/98 has been confirmed. Namely, the name of the appellant may be corrected to substitute another natural or legal person for the person indicated in the notice of appeal if the real intention was to file the appeal in the name of that person. == Practical aspects == As to answer (3), point 37 of the reasons for the decision G 1/12 provides practical guidance on how to correct an Appellant's identity under , first sentence. The correction must at least satisfy the following requirements: (a) The correction must introduce what was originally intended. (b) Where the original intention is not immediately apparent, the requester bears the burden of proof, which must be a heavy one. (c) The error to be remedied may be an incorrect statement or an omission. (d) The request for correction must be filed without delay. As to requirement (d), a decision T180/14 of April 2019 deals with a delay of four and a half years, "after the appellant had been made aware of the error for the second time". That delay did not satisfy the "without delay" requirement. (see reasons 2) == Applicability in opposition proceedings == The principles laid out in G 1/12 can also be used in opposition proceedings to correct the designation of the opponent in the notice of opposition.: "Identity of opponent and correction of opponent's name" ==References== == Further reading == * : "Correction of errors in the description, claims and drawings - " * : "Request for correction to be filed without delay" * : "Law of evidence – Introduction" * : "Principle of free evaluation of evidence" * : "Probative value of evidence on a case-by- case basis" * : "Payment of opposition fee - correction of a payment form" * : "Identity of opponent and correction of opponent's name - principles" * : "Identity of opponent and correction of opponent's name - availability of to rectify errors" * : "Formal aspects under - appeal filed by wrong company" * : "Formal aspects under - party consisting of plurality of persons" * : "Form and content of notice of appeal () - " * : "Payment of appeal fee - reduced fee for appeal filed by a natural person or an entity" * : "Referral by a board of appeal – general" * : "Referral by a board of appeal – pending proceedings" * : "Referral by a board of appeal – ensuring uniform application of the law" * : "Referral by a board of appeal – point of law of fundamental importance" == External links == * G 0001/12 () of 30 April 2014 * Decision G 1/12, Official Journal EPO 11/2014, A114 () *Decision T 445/08 of 30 January 2012 (referring decision) G 2012 1 Category:2014 in case law Category:2014 in Europe Category:Jurisdiction
