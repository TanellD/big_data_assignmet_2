The G-Force GF05 is a racing car developed and produced by American manufacturer Élan Motorsport Technologies for Panoz, with original work having been performed by G-Force Technologies prior to its purchase by Panoz, for use in the Indy Racing League. G-Force was once again a constructor for the second generation of IRL cars. G-Force would famously again visit victory lane in the Indianapolis 500 in 2000 with Chip Ganassi Racing's Juan Pablo Montoya. Élan purchased G-Force in 2002, and the production of the chassis was moved to Braselton for its final season. The second-generation G-Force IRL chassis competed in the series from 2000 to 2002. ==References== ==External links== *Élan Motorsport Technologies official website *Panoz Auto Development official website Category:Panoz vehicles Category:IndyCar Series Category:Open wheel racing cars
