The G-Unit Clothing Company is an American clothing retailer established in 2003 when 50 Cent teamed up with Marc Ecko, the founder of Ecko Unltd. to create a line of clothing and accessories by 50 Cent and G-Unit. Since its initial launch, the brand has generated $100 million in retail sales. As of 2019, the brand is exclusively sold online. ==History== The clothing line was announced in 2003 as a joint partnership between 50 Cent and Marc Eckō, founder of Eckō Unltd. The deal was said to be unique as Ecko wasn't handling the designing of the clothing, but rather the marketing and merchandising of the brand. Marc Eckō likened the deal to "Nike and (Michael) Jordan coming together for Air Jordan".Carl Chery (21 July 2003). "50 Gear For $.50; G-Unit Rides Into Calgary ". SOHH.com.
