George and Davis', George and Danver, and George and Delila, are three locations that comprise the ice cream chain G&D;′s. The chain is located in Oxford, England. ==History== G&D;'s was founded in 1992 by two Oxford students, George Stroup and Davis Roberts, who gave their names to the original café in Little Clarendon Street. G&D;'s opened a second branch, George and Danver, on the corner of St. Aldates and Pembroke Street in 2001, which make a daily selection of baked goods. Both ice-cream and bakery items are cycled from shop to shop with "ice-cream bikes." In 2007 a third shop, George and Delila, was opened on Cowley Road. It has become a venue for music events and informal concerts. == Controversy == In January 2014, George and Davis was rated one out of five for food hygiene by the Food Standards Agency. According to the chain, they complied with all criteria and hope to achieve a five star rating in due time. G&D;'s has been described by customers as "extortionately priced," though reviews overall tend to be favorable. == References == ==Further reading== * * * * Category:Ice cream parlors Category:Shops in Oxford Category:Restaurants established in 1992
