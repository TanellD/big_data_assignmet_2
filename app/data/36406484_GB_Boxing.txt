Great Britain Boxing is a team of elite amateur boxers from Great Britain, which is funded by the National Lottery and is based in the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield. The Great British boxing team is split into two squads, the 'Podium' and 'Development', and the concept is that those of the 'Podium' are largely the current Olympians, the more experienced and accomplished of the elite of amateur boxing in Britain. Whereas the Development Squad focuses on developing the future generation of boxers for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and beyond. The British Boxing team has emerged as a 'force' in the amateur boxing game in recent years. The sophisticated set-up at the 'amateur' base is supported by a team of world-class nutritionalists, physiotherapists, psychologists as well as a partnership with Soulmate Food. In 2009 Natasha Jonas became the first female boxer to compete for GB Boxing. == Training base == The GB Boxing Team are based at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield where they have a
