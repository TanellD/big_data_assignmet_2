GBR-13098 is a psychostimulant and selective dopamine uptake inhibitor. Blocking the endogenous striatal dopamine (DA) transporter with GBR-13098 in mice has been shown to prevent damage to the DA nerve terminals caused by malonate. It was suggested that DA transporter inhibitors like GBR-13098 could be used to prevent or treat neurodegenerative disorders caused by the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction on DA homeostasis. ==See also== * Vanoxerine * GBR-12783 * GBR-12935 * GBR-13069 * DBL-583 ==References== Category:Stimulants Category:Dopamine reuptake inhibitors Category:1-(2-(Bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy)ethyl)piperazines
