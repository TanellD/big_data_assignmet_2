G2 Esports (or simply G2) is a European esports organization headquartered in Berlin, Germany, with players competing in League of Legends, Valorant, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Hearthstone, Rocket League, Rainbow Six Siege, and iRacing. The organization was founded in Spain on 24 February 2014 as Gamers2 by former League of Legends pro Carlos "ocelote" Rodríguez Santiago and investor Jens Hilgers. The organization rebranded as G2 Esports on 15 October 2015. G2's League of Legends team competes in the League of Legends EMEA Championship (LEC), the highest level of competitive League of Legends in Europe. The team has won ten domestic titles in Europe, the most of any organization, and became the only Western team to win the Mid-Season Invitational in 2019. The organization's Rainbow Six Siege team competes in the European League (EUL), the highest level of competitive Rainbow Six Siege in Europe. The team became World Champion in 2019 by defeating Team Empire in the Six Invitational 2019 final and won several more Tier 1 tournaments. == Organisation == Carlos Rodríguez resigned as CEO of G2 on 23 September 2022, amidst controversy surrounding his acquaintanceship with Andrew Tate, known for his misogynistic commentary on social media. He had previously been suspended from his position after a clip of him partying with Andrew and his brother Tristan Tate went viral. Commentators later suspected this incident to be the reason for G2 being denied a franchise spot in the 2023 season of the Valorant Champions Tour. Carlos Rodriguez was later suspended from Riot- sanctioned competition until 13 November 2022, having to follow a sensitivity and executive training to be allowed back to the LEC. == Current divisions == === League of Legends === ==== History ==== Gamers2 had made a start for League of Legends in 2014 with an initial roster of Top laner Jesper "Jwaow" Strandgren, jungler Sebastián "Morden" Esteban Fernández, AD carry Soler "Yuuki60" Florent, and support Hugo "Dioud" Padioleau. The team participated in the Spring Expansion Tournament, beating Reason Gaming in the seeding game and Team Strix in Round 1. G2 were knocked out of the tournament in Round 2 after being beaten by n!faculty. G2 Esports was renamed from Gamers2 after qualifying for the 2016 EU LCS Spring Season. G2 Esports has also a sister team in Spain competing in the EU Challenger Series, called G2 Vodafone, in representation of their sponsor Vodafone. They qualified for the 2016 EU Challenger Series Summer Split Qualifiers, but failed to qualify for the EU CS. They also won the Spanish 2016 Final Cup Spring Split. The team failed to qualify for the LCS three splits in a row. The team finished 1st in the Challenger Series season. They then took 2nd in the playoffs, thereby qualifying for the 2016 Spring EU LCS. Gamers2 qualified for the LCS by defeating SK Gaming 3–2. thumb|G2 roster holding the 2016 EU LCS Summer trophy G2 finished the 2016 EU LCS Spring Split regular season in 1st place. In the playoffs, they defeated Fnatic before winning the 2016 EU LCS in Rotterdam after beating Origen. This also meant that they had qualified for the 2016 Mid-Season Invitational tournament in Shanghai. G2 would represent Europe at the competition against 5 other teams. However, in the weeks before the tournament, the team took an infamous vacation and came to the tournament unprepared. Because of this, they lost 8 of their 10 games, their only two wins against the lowest ranked seed there. This also cost the EU LCS league its 1st seed for the 2016 World Championship later that year. This meant that the 1st seed for Europe of the 2016 Summer EU LCS would be at a disadvantage in the tournament. G2 performed well in 2018 and got much further at the 2018 League of Legends World Championship than expected for a team considered an underdog, making it all the way to the Semifinals match. G2 lost to eventual world champion Invictus Gaming in the semis. Something the G2 team of 2018 was known for was unconventional picks in the bot lane; their AD carry Hjarnan was a rare Heimerdinger player. G2 retooled their team for the 2019 season, releasing their bottom lane duo of Hjarnan and Wadid, and signing Mikyx as a new support and aquaring Caps as their new midlaner from their regional rival Fnatic. Since the team now had two midlaners, Perkz was sent to the bottom lane to roleswap to AD carry. G2 became the first team to be crowned LEC champions after they won its inaugural split post namechange from EU LCS on 14 April 2019, in a 3–0 sweep against Origen. thumb|G2 holding the 2019 MSI trophy After sweeping Team Liquid from North America 3–0 in the grand final of the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational, G2 became the first European team to win a Riot-sponsored international tournament since Fnatic won the Season 1 World Championship. They finished first in the 2019 LEC Summer Split regular season and later defeated Fnatic 3–2 in the finals to secure their sixth domestic title. At the 2019 League of Legends World Championship, G2 finished runner- up, losing to Chinese team FunPlus Phoenix in the grand finals. In the 2020 LEC Spring Split, Perkz and Caps role-swapped for the split after Perkz expressed a desire to play mid lane again. G2 came first in the regular season, but lost their first playoff match against MAD Lions, resulting in a drop to the loser's bracket. From there, the team won the three remaining matches and ultimately won the split, claiming their seventh title and tying the record belonging to Fnatic. In Summer, G2 made it to the LEC playoffs; they lost to Fnatic 3–2 in the winner's bracket finals, but defeated Rogue in the loser's bracket finals and then defeated Fnatic in the Grand Finals rematch 3–0 to win the split. At the 2020 League of Legends World Championship, G2 made it to the semifinals, but were eliminated by eventual champion Damwon Gaming and finished in 3rd/4th place.2020 League of Legends World Championships recaps, DAMWON Gaming 3, G2 Esports 1. G2 revamped its roster for the 2021 LEC season, notably with trading longtime team captain Perkz to Cloud9 and acquiring Martin "Rekkles" Larson from Fnatic. While G2 finished at the top of the standings after the regular season of the 2021 Spring Split with a 14–4 record, they failed to win in the playoffs, first losing to MAD Lions, and then being eliminated by Rogue in the lower bracket. The team finished in second place in the regular season of the 2021 Summer Split, but lost to MAD Lions in the playoffs once again and were sent to the loser's bracket. There, they faced Rekkles's old team and long-time LEC rival Fnatic, and were defeated, eliminated G2 from contention. As a result, G2 failed to earn one of the LEC's three slots at Worlds, and 2021 marked the first year G2 failed to qualify for Worlds since joining the EU LCS in 2016. For the 2022 LEC season, G2 released Grabbz, Rekkles, Wunder, and Mikyx. Dylan Falco and BrokenBlade were acquired from the disbanding Schalke 04 Esports as the new head coach and top laner. Flakked and Targamas were acquired and promoted from non-LEC European leagues for the bottom lane.G2 Esports unveils 2022 League of Legends roster G2 finished fourth place in the Spring Split regular season with an 11–7 record and lost to Fnatic in their initial upper bracket playoff match.

These players, winners of the Six Invitational 2018 and multiple Pro League champions, represented the colors of G2 from 10 August 2018. Niclas "Pengu" Mouritzen was considered the most experienced player in both the team and the wider Rainbow Six Siege scene, having been in the Year 1 Season 1 PENTA roster. Fabian "Fabian" Hällsten was the in-game leader of the team to whom the strategic success and flexibility of the team was often pointed towards, as one of the best IGLs in the European Pro League. Daniel "Goga" Mazorra Romero was the only non-Nordic player on the team, and the only Spanish player in the whole of Pro League at the time. He was often praised for his ability on the games hard breachers, particularly Thermite. JNSzki was one of the 2 Finnish players on the team, being acquired from PENTA's Year 1 rival of GiFu, he has been reputed throughout the Pro League's history as one of the best aimers and Bandit players in all of Siege. The team quickly proved to be a beneficial pick-up by G2, winning the Six Major Paris and its $350,000 prize pool immediately following the purchase by defeating their rivals Evil Geniuses 3–0.

UUNO had played for the PENTA Academy being coached by G2's own coach, Thomas "Shas[O]Uas" Lee. Shas is one of the longest working coaches in Siege, originally coaching for Team Fenix, a team which had also featured Fabian and previous roster teammate of Niklas "KS" Massierer, and is still the head coach for the team. Kevin "Sua" Stahnke was the secondary coach and analyst of the roster, brought in to replace Daniel "Ferral" Rotheram, G2's original analyst. After signing Aleksi "UUNO" Työppönen and Joonas "jNSzki" Savolainen retired, G2 lost the Six Major Raleigh on 18 August 2019 after losing 3–1 to Russian rivals, Team Empire.

First Strike Europe saw G2 fall in the semi-finals to eventual champions Team Heretics which led to the benching of Davidp and the arrival of Aleksander "zeek" Zygmunt. The first half of 2021 was a contrast to the early domination and further struggles for the team saw them part ways with zeek, ardiis and paTiTek. These departures saw Žygimantas "nukkye" Chmieliauskas, Auni "AvovA" Chahade and Jose Luis "koldamenta" Aranguren Herrero added to the roster in their place.
