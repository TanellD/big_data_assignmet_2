G minor is a minor scale based on G, consisting of the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has two flats. Its relative major is B-flat major and its parallel major is G major. The G natural minor scale is: : { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \relative c { \clef treble \key g \minor \time 7/4 g4^\markup "G natural minor scale" a bes c d es f g f es d c bes a g \clef bass \key g \minor } } Changes needed for the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals as necessary. The G harmonic minor and melodic minor scales are: : { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \relative c { \clef treble \key g \minor \time 7/4 g4^\markup "G harmonic minor scale" a bes c d es fis g fis es d c bes a g } } : { \override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \relative c { \clef treble \key g \minor \time 7/4 g4^\markup "G melodic minor scale (ascending and descending)" a bes c d e fis g f! es! d c bes a g } } ==Mozart's use of G minor== G minor has been considered the key through which Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart best expressed sadness and tragedy,Hellmut Federhofer, foreword to the Bärenreiter Urtext edition of Mozart's Piano Quartet in G minor. "" ("G minor was, for Mozart, the most suitable fate-key throughout his life for the expression of pain and tragedy.") and many of his minor key works are in G minor, such as Piano Quartet No. 1 and String Quintet No. 4. Though Mozart touched on various minor keys in his symphonies, G minor is the only minor key he used as a main key for his numbered symphonies (No. 25, and the famous No. 40). In the Classical period, symphonies in G minor almost always used four horns, two in G and two in B alto.H. C. Robbins Landon, Mozart and Vienna. New York: Schirmer Books (1991): 48. "Writing for four horns was a regular part of the Sturm und Drang G minor equipment." Robbins Landon also notes that Mozart's No. 40 was first intended to have four horns. Another convention of G minor symphonies observed in Mozart's No. 25 and Mozart's No. 40 was the choice of E-flat major, the subdominant of the relative major B, for the slow movement, with other examples including Joseph Haydn's No. 39 and Johann Baptist Wanhal's G minor symphony from before 1771.James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy, Elements of Sonata Theory (Oxford University Press: 2006) p. 328 ==Notable works in G minor== * Arcangelo Corelli ** Christmas Concerto * Henry Purcell ** "Dido's Lament" from Dido and Aeneas * Antonio Vivaldi **"Summer" from The Four Seasons * Johann Sebastian Bach ** Sonata No. 1 in G minor, BWV 1001 ** Great Fantasia and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542 ** "Little" Fugue in G minor, BWV 578 ** English Suite No. 3, BWV 808 * Joseph Haydn ** Symphony No. 83 "The Hen" * Charles-Valentin Alkan ** Scherzo diabolico, Op. 39, No. 3 ** 49 Esquisses, Op. 63, no. 6 "Les cloches"; no. 26 "Petit air, Genre ancien" * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ** Symphony No. 25 ** Symphony No. 40 * Felix Mendelssohn ** Piano Concerto No. 1 * Frédéric Chopin ** Ballade No. 1 ** Nocturne Op. 37, No. 1 ** Prelude Op. 28, No. 22 "Impatience" ** Cello Sonata, Op. 65 ** Polonaise in G minor Op. posth. * Franz Liszt ** Transcendental Étude No. 6 "Vision" * Johannes Brahms ** Hungarian Dance No. 5 (orchestral version) * Camille Saint-Saëns ** Piano Concerto No. 2 * Max Bruch ** Violin Concerto No. 1, Op. 26 * Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ** Symphony No. 1, Op. 13 * Antonín Dvořák ** Slavonic Dance No. 8 * Gabriel Fauré ** Sicilienne, Op. 78 * Claude Debussy ** String Quartet, Op. 10 * Isaac Albéniz ** Cataluña * Ralph Vaughan Williams ** Mass in G minor * Sergei Rachmaninoff ** Piano Concerto No. 4 ** Prelude in G minor ** Cello Sonata * Sergei Prokofiev ** Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 16 ==See also== *Key (music) *Major and minor == References == ==External links== * Category:Musical keys Category:Minor scales
